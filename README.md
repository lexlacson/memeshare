I created a basic web3 app to share memes and add them to the Ethereum blockchain. This repo contains the smart contract. This is what the react app looks like that connects to the smart contract:

# Development

This is a hardhat project.

Some test commands:

```

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
